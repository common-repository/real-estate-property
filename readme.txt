Real Estate Property Management for real estate agents, brokers, landlords & property management companies.

== Description ==
**Real Estate Property Management**

Certain portions of this are improved & enhanced by using SwiftCRM.com, but it is not required, and you can still get value without a SwiftCRM.com account.

Web Forms for this version require a free or paid SwiftCRM.com account. This is optional. 

<a href="https://SwiftCRM.com">SwiftCRM.com</a> connection can help with
- Web Forms for viewing appointments or to inquire about a property
- Viewing Appointment Scheduler
- Autoresponder Follow-up

** 3rd Party Services **
NOTE: Portions of this code rely on google maps and/or YouTube video embeds and/or Matterport 3D Tour embeds.
Each of those are subject to their respective terms and conditions. All are optional, but enhance the system.

** FEATURES **
Demo video to follow.
This creates a custom post type for Real Estate listings.

This can also create a "single property website" type page which you can buy a domain for then redirect to your main website (which is better for SEO anyway).
It will also generate a printable flyer.


== Installation ==
Note Google Maps API key is required (free).

1. Get your Google Maps API Key here at <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/?pli=1">https://console.cloud.google.com/?pli=1</a>


Note if you choose to embed a matterport 3D Tour, you need to have a matterport account.

To create a list-view, like https://360realestategroup.com/properties you'll need a page with the following shortcode on it:
[swift-properties no_of_property="15"] // this will set the pagination to 15 per page.

To add properties, click Swift Property on the left. Ensure the section at the far bottom is filled out i.e. price, address, status.

The settings tab allows you to change certain slugs, for both translation reasons but also to avoid interference with other pages that may affect SEO.
